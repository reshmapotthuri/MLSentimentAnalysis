Multiclass Classification with ML.NET Chat Bot implementation!

🔍 What I built:
• Multiclass text classification with "OneVersusAll" algorithm using ML.NET
• Adaptive Cards for dynamic UI rendering
• Bot Framework for conversational flow and API orchestration

📊 Output: Sentiment Analysis Scores
- 😊 Positive: 59.0%
- 😠 Negative: 24.4%
- 😐 Neutral: 16.7%


🧠 Highlights:
• ML.NET Model Builder for rapid text classification prototyping
• Sentiment analysis → AdaptiveCard → ChatBot conversation flow

🖼️ Preview:
This project helped me bridge backend ML predictions with user-facing bot experiences—making outputs not just accurate, but actionable.
